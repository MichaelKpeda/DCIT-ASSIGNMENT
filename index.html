    <P><h1>Football</h1></P>
    <p>Football is a game that is cherished amongst most people in the world currently. </p>I would like to talk a little bit about this game.football is a game that is played on a rectangular field containing two teams playing against each other</p>
    <p>Each team contains eleven players containing one goal keeper and a pole he guards to prevent the opponent from scoring. <br>There is also a referee who officiates the game alongside with two linesmen. <br>It is oftenly perceived that most teams that play their football matches at home normally have the morale of the home support so they perform better most atimes and hence go forth to win the game. <br>Below are some images of how the game looks like;</p>
